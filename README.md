# Java Script ARCADE GAME
## Fend Stage 4 Submission
## What is it?

A game based on  HTML canvas and JavaScript. 

## How do I start the game?
In order to play it open the .html file in a browser of your choice.

## What rules do I need to know?
Goal of the game: reach the water at the top of the page
Key bindings: Use the arrow keys **up, down, left, right** to move the player.
If you are hit by an enemy bug the player position will be reset to starting position. Time to try again!
If you reach the water without being hit you win. _**Congratulations!**_

## How can I modify the game?
If you want to change the difficulty, you can add/ remove enemies and 
change their speed. The more enemies and the faster they are, the harder it gets. Check the last section of **js/app.js**. 
The comments below the `var player` around line 120 explain how to add enemies.
To make further changes a deeper understanding of app.js may be necessary.
Check out the comments! **;)**
