Time to try again!\r\nIf you reach the water without being hit you win. _**Congratulations!**_\r\n\r\n## How can I modify the game?\r\nIf you want to change the difficulty, you can add/ remove enemies and \r\nchange their speed. The more enemies and the faster they are, the harder it gets. Check the last section of **js/app.js**. \r\nThe comments below the `var player` around line 120 explain how to add enemies.\r\nTo make further changes a deeper understanding of app.js may be necessary.\r\nCheck out the comments! **;)**",
